# Hughes Power Watchdog in HomeAssistant via ESPHome


### Materials Needed
-   Hughes Power Watchdog Surge Protector *(any PWD model w/ bluetooth)*
-   NodeMCU ESP32
-   BLE Sniffer *(smartphone-based apps work as well)*
-   HomeAssistant w/ ESPHome add-on
    <br><br />

# Instructions

These instructions will assume that you have the latest version of HomeAssistant and the ESPHome add-on installed.

1.  Using a BLE sniffer device or BLE sniffing smartphone app, determine your device's MAC address. There are plenty of BLE sniffer apps available for free for both Android and iOS. Start by looking for a device named "PMD    ###########". Make a note of your MAC address, as you will need this later.

2.  Add the ESP32 to your ESPHome. Copy the code found [here](hughes_esphome.yaml) to your ESP32 config. Change the "*mac_address:*" to your MAC address found in step 1. Save and install to your ESP32.

3.  While your ESP32 is installing and rebooting, ensure there are no devices connected to your Hughes, including your phone. The Hughes PWD only allows a single device to connect at a time.

4.  You should now notice new sensors available in HomeAssistant. Along with the new sensors, there is a switch built-in to the integration to allow you to stop monitoring via your ESP32 in case you want to connect another device (such as the Hughes app).

### Troubleshooting
Depending on the ESP device that you are using, you may run into installation problems when ESPHome attempts to install the code OTA. A common issue is "Error 104", which typically means the ESP device ran out of memory and cannot complete the installation. This is common after the first installation because the ESP automatically connect to the PWD and is contiuously receiving data from the device, which can quickly use up memory while an installation is in progress.
<br><br>
An easy work around for this is to utilize the virtual switch built-in to the code, available via the HomeAssistant frontend. Before you install updated code, turn this switch to Off. This will disconnect the ESP from the Hughes. Once disconnected, open your mobile app and connect via the Hughes app to prevent the ESP from automatically re-connecting during the installation process. Install the new code, then disconnect the app and turn the switch back on. The ESP should reconnect shortly after that.
